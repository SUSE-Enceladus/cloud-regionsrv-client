.SH NAME
registercloudguest \- Register a SUSE Linux Enterprise on-demand instance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B registercloudguest [option]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B registercloudguest
Register a SUSE Linux Enterprise on-demand instance with the closest, in most
cases region local SUSE operated update infrastructure. The client will reach
out to a so called region server to obtain information about the region local
update servers. The information about how to find any one of the region
servers running in a given cloud framework is built into the image that
contains the registercloudguest executable. The information of the update
servers is cached to aid in HA fail-over if one of the update servers is
unreachable. The system is registered with the first responsive update server.

None of the region and update servers are resolvable via DNS and the update
server name resolution is enforced via an entry in /etc/hosts.

For on-demand instances users should not modify the default repository
configuration. It is highly likely that something on the system will break
if repositories are removed using SUSEConnect functionality. The addition
of other repositories is supported. However, adding other repositories may
cause problems when the migration path for a new service pack or distribution
upgrade is calculated. Additional repos may have to be removed prior to
migration.

The command line tool should only be used in exceptional circumstances.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--clean"
Clean the running instance of any data related to repository setup and
instance registration. Use this option when creating new images from
running instances before taking the snapshot of the root volume.
.IP "-d --delay"
Delay the process by the given number of seconds.
.IP "-f --config-file"
Specify the location of the configuration file. By default the configuration
file "/etc/regionserverclnt.cfg" is expected and used.
.IP "--force-new"
Force a new registration. This causes the previous registration data to be
discarded and the system to get re-registered as if it had never been
registered previously. This is an "emergency" switch and should be used only
in exceptional circumstances. This option and "--clean" are mutually exclusive.
.IP "--smt-fp"
Specify the fingerprint of the update server certificate. This option must be
used in conjunction with "--smt-fqdn" and "--smt-ip".
.IP "--smt-fqdn"
Specify the update server fully qualified domain name. This option must be used
in conjunction with "--smt-fp" and "--smt-ip".
.IP "--smt-ip"
Specify the update server IP address. This option must be used
in conjunction with "--smt-fp" and "--smt-fqdn".
